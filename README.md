## Creating a new branch
```
$ git checkout -b branchName
```
branchName should follow the theme `feature/exampleBranch` if it's a feature, `patch/exampleBranch` if it is patching something, or just `exampleBranch` if it is neither feature nor patch

## Booting a development server
```
$ yarn install
$ yarn serve
```

Only run the install line when you pull the repo
